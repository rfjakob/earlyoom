.SH NAME
earlyoom \- Early OOM Daemon


.SH SYNOPSIS
.B earlyoom
.RB [ OPTION ]...


.SH DESCRIPTION
The oom\-killer generally has a bad reputation among Linux users. One may have
to sit in front of an unresponsive system, listening to the grinding disk for
minutes, and press the reset button and get back to what was doing quickly
after running out of patience.

.B earlyoom
checks the amount of available memory and free swap 10 times a second.
If both are below 10%, it will kill the largest process. The percentage value
is configurable via command line arguments.


.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-m " PERCENT"
set available memory minimum to
.I PERCENT
of total (default 10 %)
.TP
.BI \-s " PERCENT"
set free swap minimum to
.I PERCENT
of total (default 10 %)
.TP
.BI \-M " SIZE"
set available memory minimum to
.I SIZE
KiB
.TP
.BI \-S " SIZE"
set free swap minimum to
.I SIZE
KiB
.TP
.B \-k
use kernel oom killer instead of own user\-space implementation
.TP
.B \-i
user\-space oom killer should ignore positive
.I oom_score_adj
values
.TP
.B \-d
enable debugging messages
.TP
.B \-v
print version information and exit
.TP
.BI \-r " INTERVAL"
memory report interval in seconds (default 1), set to 0 to disable completely
.TP
.B \-p
set niceness of earlyoom to -20 and
.I oom_score_adj
to -1000
.TP
.BI \-\-prefer " REGEX"
prefer killing processes matching
.I REGEX
(adds 300 to oom_score)
.TP
.BI \-\-avoid " REGEX"
avoid killing processes matching
.I REGEX
(subtracts 300 from oom_score)

.SH Why not trigger the kernel oom killer?
Earlyoom does not use
.I echo f > /proc/sysrq-trigger
because the Chrome people made their browser always be the first (innocent!)
victim by setting
.I oom_score_adj
very high. Instead, earlyoom finds out itself by reading through
.I /proc/*/status
(actually
.I /proc/*/statm
, which contains the same information but is easier to parse programmatically).

Additionally, in recent kernels (tested on 4.0.5), triggering the kernel oom
killer manually may not work at all. That is, it may only free some graphics
memory (that will be allocated immediately again) and not actually kill any
process.


.SH MEMORY USAGE
About 2 MiB VmRSS. All memory is locked using
.I mlockall()
to make sure earlyoom does not slow down in low memory situations.
