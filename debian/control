Description: Monitor system memory and force processes to stop if needed
 The earlyoom process checks the amount of available memory and free swap
 multiple times a second (default 10). If both are below a set limit
 (default 10%), it will kill the largest process.
 .
 The intent is to more nicely avoid Out of Memory errors that require kernel
 "OOM killer" to kill one process instead of crashing the system. Earlyoom
 can stop processes more nicely to avoid losing all disk cache before kernel
 OOM killer is finally activated.
